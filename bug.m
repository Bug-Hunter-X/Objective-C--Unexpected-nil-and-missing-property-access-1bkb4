This error occurs when you try to access an object's property that doesn't exist, or when you try to send a message to an object that isn't responding.  This can happen due to incorrect object initialization, unexpected nil values, or issues with object lifecycles.

```objectivec
// Example: Accessing a non-existent property
MyObject *obj = [[MyObject alloc] init];
NSString *value = obj.nonExistentProperty; // Causes an exception

//Example: Sending a message to a nil object
[someObject doSomething]; // Crashes if someObject is nil
```
