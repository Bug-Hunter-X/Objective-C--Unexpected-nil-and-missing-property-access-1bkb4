The solution involves explicitly checking for `nil` before accessing properties or sending messages to an object.

```objectivec
// Solution using nil checks
MyObject *obj = [[MyObject alloc] init];
NSString *value;
if (obj) {
    value = obj.myProperty; // Check if obj is not nil before accessing myProperty
}

// Solution using optional chaining
NSString *value = obj.myProperty; //If obj is nil, it will return nil without crashing

// Example demonstrating safe message sending
[someObject respondsToSelector:@selector(doSomething)] ? [someObject doSomething] : NSLog("Object doesn't respond to doSomething");

```
By implementing these checks, you prevent unexpected crashes caused by attempting operations on objects that are not properly initialized or are `nil`. This makes your Objective-C code more reliable and less prone to runtime errors.
